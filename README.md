<b>INTENT</b>

This is a small app intended for quick testing with kinect sensors before integrating into 3DJ. Currently there is a vector of ofMesh vertices to do some test drawings. Change the drawMesh() to do what you want for drawings. I will build on this base app in the future and set up more functions with kinect data for easy use. 

It would be amazing to get everyone to add new examples into this repository so we can learn from each other in a centralized place. 

All are welcome to join 3DJ, an open source project. The source code can be found at github.com/3dj. Stay tuned for an explanation on the design pattern for integrating your ideas into 3DJ. In the mean time, have fun with this app...
